## Software Development Lifecycle 

User stories get created by the development team thinking about requirements by putting themselves in the shoes of their users. This exercise keeps all development user-centric. This approach means I am developing a more valuable product. The agile iterations facilitate this by iterating over plans and increasing details in time. Time boxing user stories to be worked into sprints is a practice I will carry forward in my work to keep me focused and building value with momentum. To be a good team member in software development, one must be fully engaged and fully commited to learning and quality.
